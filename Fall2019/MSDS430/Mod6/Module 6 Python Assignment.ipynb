The data is stored in a JSON file. JSON is a popular language-independent data format derived from JavaScript. In fact, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The load method in the json module in Python can be used to parse a JSON file with result being a Python dictionary.

Their room was in the corner on the main street and they said it was a little noisier and the neon light shone in. But later hotels on the trip made them appreciate this one more. We loved the old wood center staircase. Breakfast was included and everyone was happy with waffles, toast, cereal, and an egg meal. Location was great. We could walk to shops and restaurants as well as transportation. Pike Market was a reasonable walk. We enjoyed the nearby Gold Rush Museum. Very, very happy with our stay.

We previous learned how to split a string into to create a list of words. We can write code from scratch to count the number of different words in the list. Alternatively, we can convert the list to another container data type that makes it easier to obtain this information. The `counter` module defines the `Counter` class. A `Counter` is basically a \"special type\" of dictionary. Given a list object `my_list` we can turn it into a counter object as follows: `Counter(my_list)`. This assume we already imported the class from the collections module: `from collections import Counter`. See __[Counter Module](http://rahmonov.me/posts/python-collections-counter/)__. "
